# Session Log â€” 2025-10-03 02:46 UTC

## Completed
- Added missing SVG icon imports and icon replacements across onboarding and dashboard screens to stop ReferenceError crashes in Expo Go.
- Expanded the shared SvgIcon library with close, play, and lock glyphs and swapped remaining emoji/text placeholders for icons.
- Scrubbed non-ASCII characters (emoji, bullets, special symbols) from the React Native source and replaced them with SVG icons or ASCII text.
- Updated UI copy in certificate viewer, sound diagnostics, and vault screens to keep messaging consistent after icon changes.

## Still Pending When Session Paused
- Finish reviewing every report in docs/analysis/ and cross-check the implementation gaps that remain noted there.
- Audit remaining screens/modules for compliance with the roadmap (especially optional P3 polish items) and decide which to tackle next.
- Run an Expo smoke test on device/emulator to verify the latest icon/theme fixes before resuming further work.
